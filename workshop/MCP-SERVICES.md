# Agreed MCP services and the shared travel story

This is the connection reference for Workshop Coach, not a participant
infrastructure assignment. Use these selected public, free-to-use,
no-authentication MCP services for the core workshop. Participants build two
Foundry agents and then a hosted workflow; they do not build, host, or choose
replacement MCP servers. The final workflow calls the two released agents,
not the MCP servers directly.

An MCP server is a remote service exposing callable operations called tools.
Connecting a server to Copilot does not connect it to a Foundry agent.
The core now teaches [reusable Foundry tools and Toolboxes](TOOLS-AND-TOOLBOXES.md):
save Weather's project tool connection and use it in a forecast-only
Weather Toolbox at 04, expand at 05 and verify the binding at 07, then deepen Toolbox practice
with Cultural at 11. No planned Weather migration is needed at 14.
Registration, attachment and actual execution are separate evidence boundaries.

## Selected services

| Specialist | MCP Server Endpoint | Provider's server name | Suggested Foundry server label | First allowed tool |
|------------|---------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------|
| Weather Research Agent | `https://weather.datakoot.com/mcp` | `weather-intel` | `weather_intelligence` | `weather_forecast` |
| Cultural Travel Agent | `https://mcp.travel.art/` | `travel.art` | `cultural_travel` | `find_museum_guide` |

Both use **Streamable HTTP**: the client sends MCP requests to the exact URL
above. Do not append a guessed `/sse` or `/mcp` path. No API key, authorization
header, OAuth sign-in, or credential connection is needed for these services.
Authentication and permissions are still required for the participant's
Microsoft Foundry Project. Foundry model calls, memory, telemetry, and hosted
workflow resources can incur charges; a free MCP service does not make the
workshop free. Public-service availability, terms, and limits can change.

**Verification dated 2026-10-27:** both endpoints accepted MCP `initialize`
and `tools/list` requests without credentials, negotiated protocol
`2025-03-26`, and reported the tools below. Server versions were
`weather-intel 1.0.0` and `travel.art 1.6.0`. One read-only
`find_museum_guide` request with `{"country":"US"}` returned guides for the
Metropolitan Museum of Art and MoMA in New York, with source `travel.art`,
`guideUrl`, and `lastVerified` fields. These were local authoring checks, not
Foundry runtime tests, student passes, or guarantees of future free access.
No weather retrieval or model request was made for these checks.

Provider references: [Weather & Geo](https://datakoot.com/weather-geo) and
[travel.art MCP](https://mcp.travel.art/). Recheck the live schemas before
attaching or expanding tools. Use actual returned fields, not website sample
outputs, as runtime evidence.

## Weather tools and boundaries

| Tool | Inputs from the verified schema | Workshop use |
|------|---------------------------------|--------------|
| `weather_forecast` | Required numeric `lat`, `lon`; optional boolean `hourly`, default `false` | Checkpoint 04: sole allowed tool; retrieve daily forecast periods |
| `geocode` | Required string `address`; US address or city | Checkpoint 05: resolve a supplied public location before weather retrieval |
| `weather_current` | Required numeric `lat`, `lon` | Checkpoint 05: latest station observation, not an exact measurement at a landmark |
| `weather_alerts` | Required string `area`, normally a two-letter US state code | Checkpoint 05: relevant official alerts when requested |
| `earthquakes`, `elevation` | Discover their schemas if needed for a separately approved extension | Not part of the core weather allowlist |

The provider describes US coverage for forecasts, observations, alerts, and
geocoding. Forecasts and observations come from NWS/NOAA; geocoding uses US
Census data. Confirm provenance from each result. A response may be cached:
`provenance.served_at` is the server response time, not necessarily the weather
observation time. Preserve units, station, source timestamps, and forecast
period meanings; never turn a period's start into an inferred end.

At checkpoint 04, supply public coordinates directly. Do not enable `geocode`
early merely because it appears in discovery. At 05, separately approve the
expanded four-tool allowlist and skill. The skill resolves text locations only
when necessary, chooses forecast/current/alerts according to the question, and
does not call all tools routinely. Weather evidence does not establish museum
facts, booking availability, or emergency safety.

## Cultural tools and boundaries

| Tool | Inputs from the verified schema | Workshop use |
|------|---------------------------------|--------------|
| `find_museum_guide` | Optional strings `query`, `city`, `country` (two-letter country code) | Checkpoint 11: sole allowed tool; retrieve published museum guidance |
| `find_art_events` | Optional strings `query`, `country`, `type`, `activeOn`, `startsAfter`, `endsBefore`; `type` is `biennale`, `art-fair`, `festival`, or `museum-exhibition` | Checkpoint 12: find relevant art events using the requested dates |
| `find_layover_itinerary` | Optional strings `query`, `city`, `country`, `airport`; optional numeric `maxDurationHours` | Checkpoint 12: published short art-focused layovers where catalogue coverage exists |
| `recommend_art_trip` | Required string `city`; optional date strings `startDate`, `endDate` | Checkpoint 12: published cultural trip suggestions, not the final two-agent workflow |

Date inputs use `YYYY-MM-DD`. The source is travel.art's published, curated
guides, not a live reservation system, unrestricted web search, or an official
venue feed. Include each returned canonical `guideUrl` in the answer and retain
`lastVerified` or other freshness fields when present. Do not claim a dataset
version if none is supplied. Attribute and summarize; do not copy whole guides
into repository fixtures or claim an unverified dataset license.

The server does not expose tools named `get_attractions`,
`get_cultural_guidance`, `get_accessibility_notes`, or `search_destinations`.
Do not invent them. Accessibility or etiquette advice can be attributed only
when actually returned; missing information remains unknown. Opening hours,
prices, event dates, transit timing, and accessibility require appropriate
freshness caveats. Never claim a booking, purchase, or live availability check.

At checkpoint 12 the skill selects museum, event, layover, or recommendation
tools according to the request and actual coverage. It preserves empty results
and failures rather than inventing venues or calling unrelated tools. A
provider-supplied cultural itinerary is only one evidence source: it does not
prove that our hosted workflow invoked the Weather Agent.

## First-tool configuration

These are **upstream direct-MCP reference fragments**, not the complete
reusable-connection/Toolbox configuration for the core route. They document
the selected public endpoints, tool names and approval policy, and remain
useful for historical direct-path evidence. At 04 and 11 reference the
saved upstream connection inside the domain Toolbox and attach its verified
version-specific endpoint through a separate authenticated connection,
not the direct fragment below. Retain `server_url`; the connection reference
does not replace it. Use discovered qualified names. Do not append a guessed connection
field or use a public upstream URL in place of a Toolbox endpoint.

These fragments are not complete agent definitions or
permission to create versions. After project access, current API support, live
schema discovery, and participant approval, attach only the fragment for the
current specialist on an explicitly agreed direct/partial route, or use its
upstream settings in the rehearsed core integration. Keep the chosen model and existing
versions unchanged. Do not attach both servers to one specialist.

Weather checkpoint 04:

```json
{
  "type": "mcp",
  "server_label": "weather_intelligence",
  "server_url": "https://weather.datakoot.com/mcp",
  "allowed_tools": ["weather_forecast"],
  "require_approval": "always"
}
```

Cultural checkpoint 11:

```json
{
  "type": "mcp",
  "server_label": "cultural_travel",
  "server_url": "https://mcp.travel.art/",
  "allowed_tools": ["find_museum_guide"],
  "require_approval": "always"
}
```

Use the installed Foundry skill and currently supported client to create and
independently read back the approved candidate. SDKs may normalize allowlists;
verify equivalent semantics and no additional tools. Do not create a credential
connection for an authless server or weaken approvals. Approve a bounded model
request separately from its actual proposed tool call and continuation.

## Build-up story the coach teaches

Use a fictional art-and-weather trip to **New York, US**, as the shared example.
The cultural catalogue check above establishes museum coverage; verify usable
weather results during the approved lesson. Select travel dates within the
actual returned forecast horizon. A guide's verification date is not a travel
date, and a forecast cannot establish weather months in advance.

Existing participants keep their approved targets, versions, and historical
test inputs. Do not repeat an earlier Washington, DC or other valid test merely
to switch this example or balance the coach/participant sending ratio.

| Checkpoints | Small learning steps and evidence |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| 01-03 Weather foundation | Create the tool-free agent; test a stable concept such as why rain forms. Improve only instructions and compare the same inputs. Prove follow-up context in one managed Conversation and isolation in a new one. It cannot retrieve a forecast yet. |
| 04 Weather first tool | Connect only `weather_forecast`. Example prompt: "For New York, US, latitude 40.7128 and longitude -74.0060, retrieve the daily forecast with hourly=false. Use those coordinates exactly." Review the actual tool approval, result, grounded answer, and matching trace. |
| 05 Weather skill | Add the approved geocoding/current/alerts tools and a versioned research procedure. Practice a public museum address, appropriate weather-tool choice, restraint, and partial failure. |
| 06-07 Weather memory and release | With consent, store a Celsius preference; prove recall, isolation, correction, and deletion. Retest tools and skill; release only a passing independent weather specialist. |
| 08-10 Cultural foundation | Create a separate tool-free agent; test a stable question such as how an art museum differs from an art fair. Refine its instructions and independently prove Conversation continuity and isolation. Do not copy Weather state. |
| 11 Cultural first tool | Connect only `find_museum_guide`. Example prompt: "Use the museum-guide tool to find the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, US. Summarize the returned guidance, cite its guide URL, and state its verification date if supplied." Inspect actual arguments, result, attribution, and trace; no weather retrieval. |
| 12 Cultural skill | Expand only to the four verified cultural tools. Use museum-plus-event questions for multi-tool practice; use a covered European city for a separate layover test, not a US weather request. Demonstrate missing catalogue/accessibility data and a controlled partial failure. |
| 13-14 Cultural memory and release | With consent, remember museums over nightlife in an independent scope. Prove the same memory lifecycle, regressions, and independent release as for Weather. |
| 15-16 Final workflow | After both releases pass, define result contracts and implement a hosted Agent Framework workflow. One trip request invokes both released specialists, validates both results, and assembles a sourced itinerary with weather-aware choices, guide links, uncertainties, and explicit partial failures. Correlated traces must prove both calls; two manual replies or `recommend_art_trip` alone do not pass. |

Follow the lesson files and tests for each gate; this table is the fixed teaching
story, not authorization to skip steps or run the whole workshop at once.
Keep the planned 50/50 coach/participant test mix, exact navigation, copy-ready
prompts, cost boundaries, approval stops, actual evidence, and teach-backs.
Students choose their own capstone only after this shared workflow.

Follow the five-to-six-hour core agenda: teach the method with Weather and
use shorter reminders for Cultural Travel. Supply MCP details and require
independent evidence for both without repeating the full explanation or trace
tour. The student-chosen capstone is an optional separate follow-on.

## Coach recovery when connection details appear missing

1. Read this file before asking a participant for an MCP endpoint. Both core
   addresses and tool progressions are already selected.
2. Discover `initialize` and `tools/list` on the exact service without sending
   credentials or private data. Discovery is not tool execution or proof of
   Foundry-side reachability. Inspect tool calls only within the approved scope.
3. If discovery succeeds, compare the live names and inputs with this reference,
   explain the current one-tool or multi-tool change, and request approval.
   Never attach all discovered tools automatically.
4. If blocked, report the exact endpoint, operation, and error, distinguishing
   missing local tooling, public-service availability, and Foundry access or
   runtime failure. Preserve progress and involve the facilitator. Do not ask a
   beginner to design infrastructure, request an API key, deploy a substitute,
   disable approval, or fabricate an unavailable result.
